      <h3>Executive Summary</h3>

      <p>On November 24, 2014, personally identifiable information about Sony
      Pictures Entertainment employees and their dependents, e-mails between
      employees, information about executive salaries at the company, copies of
      unreleased Sony films, and other information, was obtained and released by
      a hacker group going under the moniker "Guardians of Peace" or
      "GOP".</p>

      <p>Although the motives for the hack have yet to be revealed, the hack has
      been tied to the planned release of the film The Interview, which depicts
      an assassination attempt on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, with the
      hackers threatening acts of terrorism if the film were to be released.</p>

      <p>Recently, a team of <%= @how_many_researchers %> researchers from <%=
      @vendors %> examined the evidence left behind by the attackers. This
      research has provided insight into the likely source of these attacks.
      Though not definitive, our analysis provides a much clearer picture and
      suggests <%= "#{@actor['prefix']} #{@actor['long_name']}" %> operating
      out of <%= @country['long_name'] %> is responsible for the data breach
      impacting Sony Pictures Entertainment.

      <% if ['State-affiliated','Nation-state'].include?(@actor['variety']) and @country['abr'] == "NK" %>
        <%= erb :totally_korea %>
      <% else %>
        <%= erb :not_korea %>
      <% end %>

      <p>The research team is quite certain, however, that the Guardians of
      Peace hacker group   played no role in this attack. The clues left behind
      confirm that the group claiming   responsiblity were a fabrication to
      throw investigators off the trail and   to mask the true source.</p>

      <h3>Links to <%= @country['country'] %></h3>
      <p>The research team was able to reconstruct the attack from the ground up and
      discovered a number of IP addresses that are linked to other attacks that
      have been attributed to <%= @country['country'].titlecase %> as well as the presence
      of <%= @country['people'].titlecase %> text in the comment strings of the malware
      that was recovered during the forensic investigation. Some of these malware
      samples have also been used in <%= @country['people'].titlecase %> attacks.</p>

      <% if @country['abr'] == "CN" %>
      <p>Some of the Chinese strings even went so far as to taunt the executives
        at Sony Pictures Entertainment. For example, one of the samples that
        exfiltrated unreleased movies from the victim organization contained the
        string "你知道这是不真的吗" which is an expression Chinese people utter whenever
        the Japanese Prime Minister visits the Yasukuni Shrine in Japan (Sony is
        a Japanese company).</p>
